## Dutch Social Media Analysis

This project is about the Dutch Social Media. It used the ***Dutch Social Media Collection*** from ***Kaggle***. 
Tha data set had 10 files of many tweets from different people in Dutch language and/or for users who had mentioned that they were from within Netherlands geographical borders.

At first, I wanted to identify the most active users on the platform - those who post the most - and analyze their behavior. To achieve this, I needed to address the problem of missing values. Therefore, I determined the most common missing values in the data, which enabled me to avoid any inaccuracies or mistakes in the analysis.

Next, I created a pie chart to display the regions of the top 10 "influencers" (the most active Twitter users in our data) and a stacked bar chart to show their daily activity on the platform. This helped to reveal that most of the influencers had a daily habit of posting on Twitter.

Then, I analyzed the sentiment score across all users over time by creating line graphs. I guess that periods with less positive posts were potentially associated with unfortunate events but of course, this is not something that came out of research so this is not particularly the case-it is only an assumption. Similarly, I analyzed the days of the week where sentiment scores increased or decreased.

Finally, I generated a word cloud to identify the most common topics of the tweets posted during this period. Covid-19 emerged as the dominant topic.
